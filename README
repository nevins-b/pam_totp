/etc/pam.d/sshd or /etc/pam.d/system-auth:

[...]
auth required pam_totp.so [debug] [use_authtok] [config=/etc/pam_totp.conf]

This line forms the following url encoded POST data:
user=<username>&passwd=<pass>&mode=PAM_AUTH&hostname=<hostname>t&do=auth
It should return either 200 OK with PSK in the body or 403 Forbidden if unsuccessful.
